We thought it would be best for everyone to stay healthy this month. So, instead 
of meeting in person we thought we would suggest activities you can do at your computer 
at home. 

## Story Telling
The theme this week is using computers to tell stories.
Computers help your stories come to life. Stories on the computer can have sounds and graphics. 
Stories on a computer can also let the reader make choices that affect how the story ends.

### Scratch
Scratch is a great way to tell stories. Scratch has a lot of built-in scenes and
character graphics that you can use to tell your story.

If you need help getting started, watch the [*Tell a Story* tutorial](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=tell-a-story) to learn how to add a backdrop and characters, get the characters talk to each other, and
change the backdrop.

### Twine
[Twine](https://twinery.org/) is a tool that lets you create stories that give the reader of your story a choice.
Each part of a Twine story can connect to another part! We created a short video about how to get started:

Twine can be used on its own to build interactive stories that you can share with readers. 
However, you might use Twine to help you organize a complex story. Once you are finished writing, 
you might turn it into a Scratch project for people to play through with sounds and graphics.

### Challenge
Now that you know about some tools for creating stories, why don't you create a story of your own? 
If you're stuck here are some starting ideas for stories you might want to tell:

- Your character finds something he or she had lost...
- On your characterâ€™s favorite holiday, she does...
- Your character is out talking a walk when he or she sees a dog that...

## Sharing Your Projects

Since we are all working from home this week, it's much harder for us to show each other what
we've built. 

- Take a photo or a video of your project
- Write a short summary of what you did
- Share a link to your project (see below)

If you make something cool, let us know! We will put it on this website so others can see it!

1. Create an account on the [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/) by clicking on the "Join" button on
   front page.

2. In the pop-up, check the name of your project is correct and click the "Publish project" button.
3. On the following page in the pop-up copy the link.

2. Save the HTML file. This file contains your story. If you open it, you can read your story. You can
   also send the file to someone else and they should be able to open it to read your story..
3. If you want to edit your Twine story on a different computer, you can use the "Import from file" command in the main screen to load the HTML file you saved in step 2. You should see your story in the list of stories.
