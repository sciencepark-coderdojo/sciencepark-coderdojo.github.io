We thought it would be best for everyone to stay healthy this month. So, instead 
of meeting in person we thought we would suggest activities you can do at your computer 
at home. We are still working on getting this content ready so stay tuned!

## Things to look forward to
- A cool storytelling tool that we recently learned about
- Suggestions for things to try
- Tips for saving and sharing your projects with other CoderDojo Ninjas
- Ways to get in touch with a mentor if you need help

As always, if there's something you're working on already you should work on that!
