This Dojo we used [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) to build games. Attendees built shooter games, 
maze games, and avoid-the-enemy games.

### Did you know?
You can play your game on an actual handheld video game hardware too.
Check out the "Hardware" section at the bottom the MakeCode page.
