The February CoderDojo was the best-attended we have had so far! We had a lot of newcomers
and some familiar faces.

One of the most memorable parts of today's dojo was our organizer Nobert pretending 
to be a robot. Our attendees split into four teams and took turns controlling him to
pick up sticky notes scattered around the space. Norbert ran into people and furniture
and we all learned that we need to be super explicit when dealing robots (and computers).

The two programming activities we introduced today were:

[Rock Band](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-band) in Scratch <br />

and [Turtle Graphics](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/turtles/) in Python. <br />

Some of the highlights of what our Dojo attendees showed off were a 
football goalkeeping game made in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), 
a Maze game made in [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com), and 
a remote controlled Raspberry Pi Robot.
