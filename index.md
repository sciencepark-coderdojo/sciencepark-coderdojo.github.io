### What is CoderDojo?

CoderDojo makes learning to code a fun, sociable, and creative experience.

It is a global, open-source, volunteer-led movement that organizes free, not-for-profit coding clubs (Dojos) for young people aged 7–17. At a Dojo, young people learn to program and develop websites, apps, programs, and games, they build things with code and electronics, and much more. Members also meet like-minded people, show off what they’ve been working on, and they can take part in national and international events, such as our Coolest Projects showcase.
