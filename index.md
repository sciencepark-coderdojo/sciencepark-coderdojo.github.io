### Have Fun and Learn to Code!

CoderDojo is a programming club where young people can learn to code, be inspired by their peers, 
and, most importantly, have fun! At each session attendees socialize, participate in coding activities, 
and then share their work with each other.

Everyone is welcome, regardless of coding experience. Our intro activities are suitable for
attendees who are coding for the very first time. Seasoned coders can come to discover new
tools and languages or get help implementing their own projects from our volunteers.
