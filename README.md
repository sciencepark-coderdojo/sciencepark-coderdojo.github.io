# Website For Cambridge Science Park CoderDojo

This is the GitHub Pages repo for the [Science Park CoderDojo website](https://sciencepark-coderdojo.github.io) 
The files stored in this repo are automatically converted into a set of HTML pages that make up 
the website.

## Organization

The key parts of the site are:
- `_config.yml`: main configuration for the site
- `_pages/`: holding infrequently-changing pages (like the About page)
- `_posts/`: holding an periodically updated set of event reports and articles

## Resources

The metadata and naming conventions in this repo follow those required by the jekyll site generator.
Refer to the jekyll documentation to learn how to create new [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
and [pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

The site currently uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) 
jekyll theme. The theme offers a number of configuration and layout options, which are described in the 
[theme documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/)
