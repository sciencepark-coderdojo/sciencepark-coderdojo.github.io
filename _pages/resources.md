We encourage everyone to share their favourite languages, activities and programmable objects during 
our CoderDojo events. We keep a running list of them here. Are we missing anything? [Let us know!](mailto:info@camcoderdojo.com)

## Programming Languages and Environments

[Micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) - Block-based language to program the Micro:bit, a miniature computer with lights,
buttons, and sensors. No hardware is required since the environment includes simulated hardware. In fact, it is faster
to test your program with the simulator.

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - Block-based language that allows you to put together sounds, graphics, and animations. Can be used to create games and tell stories.

[Makecode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) - Block-based language with a lot of built-in features that makes it easy to make arcade-style games. When your program is ready, [Makecode Arcade-compatible devices](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware) allow you to play your game on a real handheld machine.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) - Text-based language used for a wide variety of tasks by professionals
and novice programmers alike. If you are using a Raspberry Pi or a Linux PC, your computer may already have 
Python installed! Otherwise, download the tools from the official Python site to get a copy that will run regardless
of whether you are connected to the Internet. You can also use tools like [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) to try out Python from your browser.

## Activities and Tutorials

[Raspberry Pi Code Club](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/codeclub) - Step-by-step lessons for learning Scratch, HTML/CSS, Python.

[Raspberry Pi Projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects) - A huge library of project guides for different
hardware and software.

[Scratch Ideas](https://scratch.mit.edu/ideas) - Activities and ideas for Scratch.
