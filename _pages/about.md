### Do I already need to know how to code?

No, the Dojo is open to complete beginners as well as to young people who have coded before: we have skilled mentors who will help with technical questions. Please note that we have a limited amount of spaces, so remember to sign your child up in advance for each session. We look forward to welcoming you both to our Dojo!

### What is a typical session like?

A typical session is about 90 minutes long:

- **15m Warming up** - play a few games so the children meet each other and feel more comfortable
- **60m Coding** - in front of the computer the children will actually do this weeks challenge. Or if they have brought their own project from home, they can work on that and ask for help.
- **15m Sharing** - each child shares with a few of his peers what they have been working on.

### What do I need to bring?

You will need to bring a laptop. A tablet will also work, but a laptop is better.

### How do you make money?

We don't actually. It is all 100% volunteer based. The Bradfield Centre are sponsoring the venue and the Mentors/Organizers are doing it because they want to inspire young children to pursue careers in STEM.

## Coder Dojo Foundation

The CoderDojo Foundation was established in 2013 by CoderDojo co-founder James Whelton. Due to CoderDojoâ€™s rapid growth, we need a structured entity to support us and help us scale, which is where the Foundation comes in. CoderDojo and the Foundation share the same vision: every child worldwide should have the opportunity to learn code and to be creative with technology in a safe & social environment.

In 2017, the CoderDojo Foundation joined forces with the Raspberry Pi Foundation to further accelerate our mission and vision globally.
